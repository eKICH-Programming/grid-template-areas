# grid-template-areas

In this Grid Template Areas, we are creating a website layout from scratch using CSS Grid Layout System.
We use CSS Grid property grid-template-areas to define our grid areas.
We move forward and asign the grid-template-areas names that are used to place the areas on the layout.
We also, use the grid-template-areas to make our CSS Grid website layout responsive.
